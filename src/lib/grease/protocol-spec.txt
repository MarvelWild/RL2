Packet structure:

+---+-----+--------+------+---+-----+
| 0 | STX | HEADER | BODY | 0 | ETX |
+---+-----+--------+------+---+-----+

Body needs to be escaped, using ESC, so:
(ESC|STX|ETX) --> ESC ESC
                  ESC STX
                  ESC ETX

Then unescaping is:

ESC x --> x

Header:

+------+-----+
| TYPE | EXT |
+------+-----+

Type is a byte which is one of:
 - CONNECT (0x01)
 - DISCONNECT (0x02)
 - DATA (0x03)
 - CONTINUATION (0x04)
 - CONNACK (0x05)
 - PING?

 If TYPE is not DATA nor CONTINUATION then EXT is empty (0-length).
 If it is DATA or CONTINUATION EXT looks like:

 +-------+---+--------+
 | SEQNO | 1 | CONTNO |
 +-------+---+--------+

 Where SEQNO is a unique (usually monotonic) sequence number identifying a data
 packet and its continuations. And CONTNO is a number identifying this specific
 continuation. The DATA packet has as CONTNO, the number of continuations to
 follow. The first CONTINUTION packet has a CONTNO of 1, any following
 CONTINUATION packet has a CONTNO of 1 + the previous packet's CONTNO. SEQNO and
 CONTNO are single bytes, which wrap around. Note that CONTNO is not allowed to
 wrap around in normal operation. The 1 byte is to prevent \0STX and \0ETX
 occurring in the header.
